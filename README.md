# Covid-19 Global Impact

This exploratory analysis and visualization project delves into the global impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, using data on death counts, infection rates, vaccination rates, and other metrics. With over 290k rows of data collected from the official [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) website and imported into SQL, I analyzed trends and patterns to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on a global scale. **View the SQL queries [here](https://github.com/jessicabohannon/Covid-Exploration-in-SQL/blob/main/SQL_CovidExploration)**.

**[Click here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jessica4478/viz/CovidDashboard_16769162362800/CovidDashboard)** to view the Tableau dashboard, which provides a clear and interactive overview of the Covid pandemic, highlighting the key trends and insights discovered through analysis. Forecast indicators are added to anticipate infections through 2024.

This project showcases my proficiency in using SQL and Tableau to analyze and present data effectively. I hope it will be a valuable resource for anyone seeking to understand the impact of the pandemic.
